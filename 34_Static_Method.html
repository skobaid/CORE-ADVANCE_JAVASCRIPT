<!--Static Defination

The static keyword defines a static method or property for a class, or a class static initialization
 block (see the link for more information about this usage). Neither static methods nor static 
 properties can be called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself.

Static methods are often utility functions, such as functions to create or clone objects, whereas 
static properties are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data you don't need to be
 replicated across instances.
