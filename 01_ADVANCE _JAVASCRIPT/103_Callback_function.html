<!-- 
    Callback function is a function (It can be anonymous function, Arrow function) passed into another function
    as an argument into another function as an argumnet , which is then invoked inside the outer function to
    complete some kind of routine or action.

    Synchronous:=>
        It waits for each operation to complete, after that it executes the next operation..

    Asynchronous:=>
        It never waits for each operation to complete, rather it executes all operations in the first GO only.
