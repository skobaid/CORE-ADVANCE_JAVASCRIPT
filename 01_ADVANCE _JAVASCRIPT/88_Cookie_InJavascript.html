<!-- 
    Cookie :-It is a samll piece of text data set by web browser that resided on the client's machine .
    Once it's been set, the client Automatically returns the cookie to the web server with each request 
    that it makes.This allows to server to place value it wishes to 'remember' in the cookie, and have 
    access to them when creating response. 

    Type of Cookie:=
        Session cookie:==> cookie that are set witout the expires field are called session cookie. It is 
    destroyed when the user quit browser.
