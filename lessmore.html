	<h3>Show More and Show Less Example</h3>

	<p>
		GeeksforGeeks was born out of necessity-
		a need to provide a convenient and
		one-stop educational portal to all the
		students of Computer Science.
		<span id="points">...</span>

		<!-- Define the text that would be
			hidden by default and only shown
			when clicked on the button -->
		<span id="moreText"> This necessity was
			as personal to me as it was universal.
			This need combined with my passion for
			teaching resulted in GeeksforGeeks as
			we know today. My message to you, in
			our inaugural edition of Geeks Digest,
			would be that if you are looking for
			a problem to work on, you donâ€™t need
			to look very far for it. All you should
			do is to look around yourself.

	<!-- Trigger toggleText() when the
		button is clicked -->

		Show More

			// Get all the elements from the page
			var points =

			// If the display property of the dots
			// to be displayed is already set to
			// 'none' (that is hidden) then this
			// section of code triggers
			if (points.style.display === "none") {

				// Hide the text between the span
				// elements
				showMoreText.style.display = "none";

				// Show the dots after the text
				points.style.display = "inline";

				// Change the text on button to
				// 'Show More'
				buttonText.innerHTML = "Show More";

			// If the hidden portion is revealed,
